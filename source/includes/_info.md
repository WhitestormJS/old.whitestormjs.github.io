## Variations

You can choose a version of WhitestormJS that you need. By default, there are 2 variations that comes after each build, `whitestorm.js` and `whitestorm.light.js` (light version).

- `whitestorm.js` - Original framework with all classes/functionality included. (With physics)
- `whitestorm.light.js` - A stripped-down version without physics and it's libaries. Should be used if you don't need physics and want to reduce your scripts size for loading performance improvement. All non-physics parts of framework are same as in it's original version.
