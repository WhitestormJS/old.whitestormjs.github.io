> WHS.Cylinder example: 

```javascript

var cylinder = GAME.Cylinder({
    geometry: {
        radiusTop: 2,
        radiusBottom: 4,
        height: 5
    },

    mass: 10,

    material: {
        color: 0xffffff,
        kind: "basic"
    },

    pos: {
        x: 0,
        y: 100,
        z: 0
    }
});

```


`WHS.Cylinder` is a simple class, it extends `WHS.Shape` and inherits all it's methods.

A **cylinder** is one of the most basic curvilinear geometric shapes, the surface *formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given straight line, the axis of the cylinder.* The solid enclosed by this surface and by two planes perpendicular to the axis is also called a cylinder. The surface area and the volume of a cylinder have been known since deep antiquity.

`WHS.Cylinder` creates Cylinder object by it's `radiusTop`, `radiusBottom` and `height`

Parameter         |       Default        | Type      | 
----------------- | -------------------- | --------- | 
**radiusTop**     | 1                    | `Number`  |
**radiusBottom**  | 1                    | `Number`  | 
**height**        | 1                    | `Number`  |
**radiusSegments**| 32                   | `Number`  |
