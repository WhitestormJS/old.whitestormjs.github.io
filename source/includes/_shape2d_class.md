`WHS.Shape2D` is a simple class, it extends `WHS.Shape` and inherits all it's methods.

`WHS.Shape2D` is an universal class, that allows you create different 2D shapes in 3D scene. Unfortunately, all of them don't support physics, so you can make a similar 3D obect and scale it width to be near zero.

`WHS.Shape2D` consist of shapes that are in `shapes` parameter.
